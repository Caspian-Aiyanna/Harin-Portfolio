# About Me

I am a nature conservation professional working at the intersection of **field ecology, geospatial analysis, and species distribution modeling (SDM)**.  
My work blends ecological insights with open-source tools to inform real-world conservation decisions.

I hold an M.Sc. in Forest Sciences (University of Padua), with an Erasmus exchange at Wageningen UR.  
My focus areas include ecological modeling, remote sensing, stakeholder-driven conservation, and environmental communication.
